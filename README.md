## üéØ **Goal**

The zop.dev Helm Charts repository is designed to **simplify the deployment and management** of popular datastores and applications on Kubernetes. With pre-configured charts that work out-of-the-box and allow for explicit overrides, our goal is to streamline operations and integrate seamlessly with the zop.dev ecosystem.

---

## üí° **Key Features**

1. **Zero Configuration Required:**  
   Charts deploy with default values‚Äîno manual configuration is needed to get started.
2. **Explicit Override Options:**  
   Users can override selected parameters through a dedicated `values.yaml` with a corresponding `values.schema.json` that marks user-modifiable fields with `"mutable": true`.
3. **Automatic Integration:**  
   Every chart includes a required metadata annotation (`type: datasource` or `type: application`), ensuring automatic reflection in the zop.dev Applications and Datasources section.
4. **Scalability & Flexibility:**  
   Designed to adapt to various production workloads with ease.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
- **Helm:** Ensure [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) is installed.
- **Kubernetes:** Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.

### **Installation**

To add the zop.dev repository and install a chart, run:

```bash
helm repo add zop https://helm.zop.dev
helm install <release-name> zop/<chartname>
```

---

### **Examples**

### **Deploying an Application Chart:**

  ```bash
  helm repo add zop https://helm.zop.dev
  helm install my-app zop/service
  ```

### **Overriding Values:**

  To customize certain values that are marked mutable, provide a custom `values.yaml`:

  ```bash
  helm install my-app zop/service -f values.yaml
  ```

### **Upgrading & Uninstalling:**

  Upgrade an existing release:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade my-app zop/service --set ingress.enabled=true
  ```

###  Uninstall a release:

  ```bash
  helm uninstall my-app
  ```

###  Verify your deployments:

  ```bash
  helm list
  ```
