# Helm Charts

This repository contains the Helm charts for various datastores. Users can easily install these charts and use it in the Kubernetes Clusters.

## Description

This project provides Helm charts for setting up and managing popular datastores with ease. Each chart is pre-configured to help users deploy, manage, and scale these datastores efficiently in their Kubernetes environments.

## Installation

To install a specific datastore's Helm chart, use the following command:

```bash
helm repo add zop https://helm.zop.dev
helm install <release-name> zop/<chartname>
```

Replace `<release-name>` with your desired release name and `<chartname>` with the name of the datastore chart.

## Usage

Each datastore comes with a Helm chart that supports various configurable parameters. Below are examples for specific use cases:

### Install a Datastore Chart

To install a specific datastore, such as `redis`, run:

```bash
helm repo add zop https://helm.zop.dev
helm install my-redis zop/redis
```

This will deploy a `redis` instance with the default configuration.

### Customize Values

You can override default values during installation by providing a `values.yaml` file:

```bash
helm install my-redis zop/redis -f values.yaml
```

Alternatively, you can pass parameters directly via the command line:

```bash
helm install my-redis zop/redis --set image="redis:6.2.13"
```

### Upgrade a Chart

To upgrade an existing chart deployment, use:

```bash
helm upgrade my-redis zop/redis --set diskSize="5Gi"
```

### Uninstall a Chart

To uninstall a datastore deployment, use:

```bash
helm uninstall my-redis
```

### Verify Installation

To verify the installation, check the status of the release:

```bash
helm list
kubectl get pods
```
