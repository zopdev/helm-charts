# SolrCloud Helm Chart

This Helm chart deploys Apache SolrCloud on Kubernetes, providing a highly available, distributed search platform. SolrCloud is built on Apache Solr and offers features like distributed indexing, automatic sharding, and fault tolerance.

---

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.0+
- kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
- Solr Operator installed in the cluster (automatically installed as a dependency)

---

## Dependencies

Before installing the chart, you need to download the required dependencies. Run the following command in the chart directory:

```bash
helm dependency build
```

This command will:
1. Read the dependencies from `Chart.yaml`
2. Download the required charts (Solr Operator) from the specified repositories
3. Store them in the `charts/` directory
4. Create or update the `Chart.lock` file with the exact versions

If you encounter any issues with the dependencies, you can try:
```bash
helm dependency update  # Updates dependencies to the latest versions
```

This chart requires the following dependencies to be installed:

### Solr Operator
- **Chart**: `solr-operator`
- **Version**: `0.0.1`
- **Repository**: `https://helm.zop.dev`
- **Purpose**: Manages the SolrCloud cluster lifecycle, including scaling, updates, and maintenance operations

To install this dependency automatically, ensure the following in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
solr-operator:
  enabled: true
  # Additional Solr Operator configuration...
```

The dependency will be automatically installed when you deploy the SolrCloud chart. You can customize its configuration through the respective section in your `values.yaml` file.

---

## Add Helm Repository

Add the Helm repository by running:

```bash
helm repo add zopdev https://helm.zop.dev
helm repo update
```

For more details, see the [Helm Repository Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/).

---

## Install Helm Chart

To deploy the SolrCloud Helm chart, use the following command:

```bash
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] zopdev/solrcloud
```

Replace `[RELEASE_NAME]` with your desired release name. Example:

```bash
helm install my-solrcloud zopdev/solrcloud
```

You can override default values during installation by providing a `values.yaml` file.

Refer to the [Helm Install Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for further details.

---

## Uninstall Helm Chart

To remove the SolrCloud Helm chart and associated resources, run:

```bash
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

Example:

```bash
helm uninstall my-solrcloud
```

Check the [Helm Uninstall Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for more information.
