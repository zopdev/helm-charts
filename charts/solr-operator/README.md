# Solr Operator Helm Chart

This Helm chart deploys the Solr Operator on Kubernetes, which manages SolrCloud clusters and standalone Solr instances. The Solr Operator simplifies the deployment and management of Solr in Kubernetes environments.

---

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.0+
- kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster

---

## Add Helm Repository

Add the Helm repository by running:

```bash
helm repo add zopdev https://helm.zop.dev
helm repo update
```

For more details, see the [Helm Repository Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/).

---

## Install Helm Chart

To deploy the Solr Operator Helm chart, use the following command:

```bash
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] zopdev/solr-operator
```

Replace `[RELEASE_NAME]` with your desired release name. Example:

```bash
helm install my-solr-operator zopdev/solr-operator
```

You can override default values during installation by providing a `values.yaml` file.

Refer to the [Helm Install Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for further details.

---

## Uninstall Helm Chart

To remove the Solr Operator Helm chart and associated resources, run:

```bash
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

Example:

```bash
helm uninstall my-solr-operator
```

Check the [Helm Uninstall Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall/) for more information.
