# Contributing to Helm Charts

## Welcome Contributors!

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our Helm charts repository. Your contributions help improve these charts and benefit the entire community. This document provides guidelines and best practices to ensure that all contributions are consistent, high quality, and integrate seamlessly with the zop.dev ecosystem.

---

## 1. How to Contribute

### Getting Started
- **Fork** the repository.
- **Clone** your forked repository locally.
- **Create a new branch** for your contribution (e.g., `feature/`, `fix/`, or `docs/`).
- **Make your changes** and test them thoroughly.
- **Submit a pull request (PR)** with a clear title and detailed description.

---

## 2. Branching Strategy

We use a simplified Git workflow:
- The `main` branch is our primary branch for stable releases.
- Create feature branches from `main`.
- **Branch Naming Convention:**
  - `feature/`: For new features.
  - `fix/`: For bug fixes.
  - `docs/`: For documentation updates.

## 3. Code and Chart Standards

### Helm Chart Standards
- **Official Best Practices:** Follow the official Helm best practices.
- **Linting:** Ensure all charts pass `helm lint` without errors.
- **Values File:**
  - Include a comprehensive `values.yaml` file with sensible defaults.
  - If any field is intended to be user-configurable, mark it in the accompanying `values.schema.json` with `"mutable": true`.
  - If a field is not meant to be edited, mark it in the accompanying `values.schema.json` with `"editDisabled": true`.
- **Comments & Documentation:**  
  - Add comments in YAML files to explain complex configurations.
  - Document any overrideable values in the chartâ€™s README.
- **YAML Formatting:**
  - Use 2-space indentation; do not use hard tabs.
  - Keep lines under 80 characters where possible.
  - Use snake_case for variable names.

## 4. Chart Configuration Guidelines

### Metadata Guidelines
- **Required Annotation:** Every chart must include the following metadata annotation:
  ```yaml
  annotations:
    type: datasource  # or "application"
  ```
This annotation ensures that the chart is automatically reflected in the zop.dev Applications and Datasources section.


### For Application Charts (using the **service** chart)
- **Bundled Configurations:**  
  The service chart bundles configurations for:
  - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)
  - Deployments
  - Alerts and Grafana configurations
  - Ingress settings
  - Pod-distribution budgets
  - Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)
  - Service Monitors (refer to the `service-monitor.yaml` template)
  - Alerts (refer to the `alerts.yaml` template)
- **Credential Management:**  
  Application-specific credentials (ID and password) are automatically managed via templated files (e.g., `<release-name>-login.yaml`). Users do not need to provide these values manually.

### For Datasource Charts
- **Minimal Configuration:**  
  Datasource charts are optimized to require only the essential inputs, minimizing the configuration overhead for users.

## 5. Testing Requirements

### Before Submitting a Pull Request
- **Lint Your Chart:**  
  Run `helm lint` on your chart to catch any issues.
- **Dry Run Installation:**  
  Test chart installation with:
  ```bash
  helm install --dry-run --debug mychart ./path/to/your/chart
  ```
- **Functionality Testing:**  
  Ensure that all default configurations work as expected.
- **Uninstallation Testing:**  
  Ensure that the chart can be uninstalled smoothly without producing errors.
